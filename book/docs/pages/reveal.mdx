# Reveal

Tiles are issued from the deck randomly. In both solo and multiplayer modes, the first tile is auto played when the game starts.

In solo mode: the game ends once all **72** tiles have been paved.

In multiplayer mode: the game ends when time runs out. Once exhausted, the deck **99** tiles is reset, randomised and issued as before.

Tiles are initially hidden. Players reveal the tiles by clicking `👁️‍🗨️`.

Once revealed, the tile is 'in hand'.

Burn the tile to destroy it and get issued a new one (**50** point penalty received) by clicking `🔥`.
