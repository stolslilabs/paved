# Scoring

Points are scored when structures are closed. Certain character bonuses exist (see **Characters**), as well as bonuses for growing larger cities and roads. In multiplater mode, the player with the most points at the end of a game is the winner.

## Tiles

Each tile has a points value. Once a structure is closed, a player is rewarded an accumulation of points according to the total tiles within it.

## Growing Cities, Roads & Forrests

Cities and roads have an ever increasing multiplier bonus system according to the number of tiles within them. This is outlined in the following curve, where **y=1.0235^{x}**.
